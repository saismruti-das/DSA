## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Summary
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of two numbers such that they add up to the target. Assume only one solution exists.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Approach-1: Brute Force (Nested Loop)

- Use two loops to check every pair `(i, j)`
- If `nums[i] + nums[j] == target`, return `[i, j]`

---

## ðŸ’» Code (Java)
See `code1.java` file

## ðŸ§  Learning

- Time Complexity: **O(nÂ²)** â€” not efficient for large arrays
- Space Complexity: **O(1)** â€” no extra space
- Can be improved using a **hash map** for O(n) time

---

## âœ… Next Step

Try solving it again using:
- Hashing (store `target - nums[i]` in map)
- One-pass efficient method
